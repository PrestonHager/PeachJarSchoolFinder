# Peachjar School Finder

We got annoyed at using Peachjar's school finder since it wouldn't let us see all the schools at once and it wouldn't let us sort by students.
So we created our own searcher.
With a bit of Python magic we added the total number of students to the JSON file containing all schools.
Now you can easily search for the Peachjar schools you need based on Grade and Total Number of Students.
